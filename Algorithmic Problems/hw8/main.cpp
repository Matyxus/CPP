Villages V_1 ... V_n.
P_i describes difference between production and consumption of village V_i.
To construct road between V_j and V_(j+1):
    V_i is village with lowest index, that is reachable from V_j by already constructed roads.
    V_k is village with highest index, that is reachable from V_(j+1) by already constructed roads.
    The cost of road between V_j and V_(j+1) is given by production and consumption of villages V_i...V_k.
    S_1 = P_i + ... + P_j (difference between consumption and production of villages V_i...V_j)
    S_2 = P_(j+1) + ... + P_k (difference between consumption and production of villages V_(j+1)..V_k)
    S_min  = min{S1, S2}, S_max = max{S1, S2}, S = min{|S_min|, |S_max|} and L = k âˆ’ i.
    if S_min < 0 < S_max and S > L, than the cost of road will be S-L, else 0.

Given numbers P_i describing difference of production and consumption in villages.
Given cost of construction for one road.
It is known which village is the main one.
Find optimal plan for road construction that will lead to highest profit, return the profit.
